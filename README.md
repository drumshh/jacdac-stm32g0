# JACDAC for STM32G0

You might have heard of [JACDAC](https://jacdac.org).
It's a new protocol that aims to standardize connecting microcontrollers dynamically,
and with very little wiring (one wire for data, one for GND, and optionally one for power).
One scenario is networking of MCU-based devices, for example to enable multiplayer
for your awesome [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com) games.
Another is connecting peripherals to a host device (joystick anyone?!).
